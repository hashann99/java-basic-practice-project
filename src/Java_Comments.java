// in this video we will see how to use comments in out program
// to begin with, i will create a java class called java_comments
class Java_Comments{
    // in addition to, i will create main method here
    public static void main(String args[]){

        // there is a two ways to write comments in your java program

        // 1. single-line comments

        System.out.println("i'm working,no comments");
        // System.out.println("i don't work,because i have a single line comments"); this line no work

        // 2. multi-line comments

        System.out.println("we are working, we don't have a comments");
        System.out.println("we are working, we don't have a comments");
        System.out.println("we are working, we don't have a comments");
        System.out.println("we are working, we don't have a comments");

        /*

        System.out.println("we don't work,we have multi-line comments");
        System.out.println("we don't work,we have multi-line comments");
        System.out.println("we don't work,we have multi-line comments");
        System.out.println("we don't work,we have multi-line comments");
        System.out.println("we don't work,we have multi-line comments");
